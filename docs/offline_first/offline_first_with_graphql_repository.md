# Offline First With GraphQL Repository

`OfflineFirstWithGraphqlRepository` streamlines the GraphQL integration with an `OfflineFirstRepository`. A serial queue is included to track GraphQL mutations in a separate SQLite database, only removing requests when a response is returned from the host (i.e. the device has lost internet connectivity).

The `OfflineFirstWithGraphql` domain uses all the same configurations and annotations as `OfflineFirst`.

!> You can change default behavior on a per-request basis using `policy:` (e.g. `get<Person>(policy: OfflineFirstUpsertPolicy.localOnly)`). This is available for `delete`, `get`, `getBatched`, `subscribe`, and `upsert`.

## GraphqlOfflineQueueLink

To cache outbound requests, apply `GraphqlOfflineQueueLink` in your GraphqlProvider:

```dart
GraphqlProvider(
  link: Link.from([
    GraphqlOfflineQueueLink(GraphqlRequestSqliteCacheManager('myAppRequestQueue.sqlite')),
    HttpLink(endpoint)
  ]),
);
```

!> Be sure to place the queue above `HttpLink` or `WebSocketLink` or any other outbound `Link`s.

## OfflineFirst(where:)

GraphQL is more limited than REST since the response contract is generated by Brick. Ideally, `@OfflineFirst(where:)` is never required in a GraphQL ecosystem because associations are fetched with subfields instead of subsequent requests. This functionality is subject to change and potential removal.

Always specify a `@Graphql(name:)` in conjunction with `@OfflineFirst(where:)` to ensure the document is generated correctly:

```dart
@OfflineFirst(where: {'id': "data['otherId']"})
@Graphql(name: 'otherId')
final Pizza pizza;
```

Multiple `where` keys (`OfflineFirst(where: {'id': 'data["id"]', 'otherVar': 'data["otherVar"]'})`) will be ignored. Nested properties (`OfflineFirst(where: {'id': 'data["subfield"]["id"]})`) will also be ignored.
