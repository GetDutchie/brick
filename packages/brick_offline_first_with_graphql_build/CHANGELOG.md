## Unreleased

## 1.3.1

* Merge `brickSchemaBuilder` into `brickNewMigrationBuilder` and rename to `brickSchemaBuilder` to ensure the schema is compiled before the migration. `runs_before` was not working, perhaps because of [the combination](https://github.com/dart-lang/build/blob/85900b19ee186d133b41e957fd60836282b45d7c/docs/builder_author_faq.md#why-cant-my-builder-resolve-code-output-by-another-builder) with `combining_builder`

## 1.3.0

* Upgrade analyzer to version 4
* Generate `RuntimeGraphqlDefinitions#subfields` as `Map<String, Map<String, dynamic>>` to support nested properties of JSON-encoded fields.
* Apply `@OfflineFirst(where:)` params to GraphQL document configuration. Note that the current implementation ignores multiple `where` properties (`OfflineFirst(where: {'id': 'data["id"]', 'otherVar': 'data["otherVar"]'})`) and nested values (`OfflineFirst(where: {'id': 'data["subfield"]["id"]})`).
* Support `brick_graphql` v2
