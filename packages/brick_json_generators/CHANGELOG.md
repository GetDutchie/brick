## Unreleased

- (test) remove analysis options override for non-standard library prefixes
- Revert `.getDisplayString()` change due to Flutter 3.22 being restricted to analyzer <6.4.1. `meta` is pinned to `1.12` in this version of Flutter, and `analyzer >=6.5.0`, where the change was made, requires `meta >= 1.15`. This change will eventually be re-reverted.
