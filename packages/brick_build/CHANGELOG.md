## Unreleased

## 3.0.0

* Update `AggregateBuilder#requiredImports` docs
* Remove unnecessary assignment in `BaseBuilder#replaceWithinFile`
* Update minimum `analyzer` constraint to `5.0.0`

## 2.1.2

* Remove `// This file should NOT be version controlled and should not be manually edited.` from adapter generator and model dictionary generator. Both file types can be version controlled; `manually edited` is redundant givent the preceding `GENERATED CODE DO NOT EDIT` warning

## 2.1.1

* Add `#hasEnumDeserializeFactory` and `#hasEnumSerializeMethod` to `SharedChecker`

## 2.1.0

* Upgrade analyzer to version 4

## 2.0.2

* Loosen dependency restrictions to major versions
* Fix duplicate imports to `brick.g.dart` when class names start with the same prefix

## 2.0.1

* Add `fromJsonConstructor` and `toJsonMethod` to `SharedChecker`, supporting easy discovery of standard methods `factory fromJson` and `#toJson`.

## 2.0.0

* **BREAKING CHANGE** `brick.g.dart` and `adapters` are now saved to a `brick/` folder. This replaces the `app` folder. Please rename `app` to `brick` to safely migrate.
* **BREAKING CHANGE** models are now discovered by the `.model.dart` suffix. This permits models to be stored anywhere in a package. Please rename your `models/*.dart` files to `models/*.model.dart`.
* Fix adapters builder
* Fix `brick.g.dart` imports

## 2.0.0-rc.3

* Include `1.4.0+1` changes

## 2.0.0-rc.2

* Fix adapters builder
* Fix `brick.g.dart` imports

## 2.0.0-rc.1

* **BREAKING CHANGE** `brick.g.dart` and `adapters` are now saved to a `brick/` folder. This replaces the `app` folder. Please rename `app` to `brick` to safely migrate.
* **BREAKING CHANGE** models are now discovered by the `.model.dart` suffix. This permits models to be stored anywhere in a package. Please rename your `models/*.dart` files to `models/*.model.dart`.

## 1.4.0+1

* Fix field sorting and discovery error

## 1.4.0

* Alphabetize methods (internal refactor)
* Upgrade `analyzer` dependency to `3.2.0`

## 1.3.0

* Upgrade `brick_core`

## 1.2.3

* Allow forced type nullability on `getAssociationMethod` for improved null safety on future internals.

## 1.2.2+1

* Access `checkForField` by default only when deserializing for fields instead of constructor overrides

## 1.2.2

* Add `checkForField` method to enforce constructor preference over field definition for type inference in adapter generation.

## 1.2.1

* Remove `// ignore_for_file: prefer_null_aware_operators`

## 1.2.0+3

* Remove `// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_non_null_assertion` and `// ignore_for_file: invalid_null_aware_operator` from all adapters and add `// ignore_for_file: prefer_null_aware_operators`
* Remove setting `repositoryHasBeenForceCast` in `SerdesGenerator#getAssociationMethod`

## 1.2.0+2

* Remove `@visibleForOverriding` annotation from `SerdesGenerator#deserializeNullableClause`

## 1.2.0

* Add Dart Lints
* Improve null safe checking in example
* Add `repositoryHasBeenForceCast` to determine whether a repository needs to use the null operator `!`. Warnings clutter the console when running `flutter build` or `flutter test` and they cannot be disabled with `--no-sound-null-safety`
* Convert `SerdesGenerator.getAssociationMethod` to `SerdesGenerator#getAssociationMethod` to access `repositoryHasBeenForceCast`

## 1.1.0+3

* Ignore `unnecessary_non_null_assertion` and `invalid_null_aware_operator` in adapter generated code. If a repository is forced to a non-null value (`repository!`) subsequent access of the repository must not have an operator (`repository.` instead of `repository?`). Brick determines properties on a per-member basis, requiring a break in architecture to resolve subsquent access. These are linter warnings, not errors, and therefore they're safe to ignore for adapters.

## 1.1.0+2

* Remove `part` and `export` directives during build

## 1.1.0+1

* Do not generate null-safe return values in adapters if the member cannot be null. For example, this would remove `data['name'] == null ? null :` in the REST adapter function of field that cannot be null in Dart >=2.12

## 1.1.0

* **BREAKING CHANGE** removing  `testing.dart` in favor of new package `brick_build_test`. Please use `import 'package:brick_build_test/brick_build_test.dart'` instead. `source_gen_test` is not null safe, and testing shouldn't be in distributed packages anyway.

## 1.0.0

* Null safety

## 0.0.9

* If `fromGenerator` or `toGenerator` is declared, the field will be generated for deserializing and serializing adapters, respectively
* Strictly assign analyzer ahead of nullability release versions

## 0.0.8+2

* Override build methods

## 0.0.8+1

* Remove `getInheritedConcreteMap` from `fields_for_class.dart` as it's no longer used.

## 0.0.8

* Add method `ignoreCoderForField` to `SerdesGenerator`. This doesn't change existing functionality; it only moves it to an overridable method.

## 0.0.7

* Use assignable instead of super type comparison when checking for siblings to account for inherited classes (#55)
* Add ability to overwrite the nullable check for deserializing members

## 0.0.6

* Rename `ProviderSerializable` to `ProviderSerializableGenerator` to be more explicit
* Rename `SharedChecker#mapArgs` to `SharedChecker#typeArguments`

## 0.0.4

* Update for new [brick_core](https://github.com/GetDutchie/brick/tree/main/packages/brick_core) API on `Where`
* Move shareable methods from `OfflineFirstSerdesGenerator` to `SerdesGenerator`
* Constrain version of [brick_core](https://github.com/GetDutchie/brick/tree/main/packages/brick_core)
* Split code to separate projects: `rest_serdes` to [brick_rest_generators](https://github.com/GetDutchie/brick/tree/main/packages/brick_rest_generators), `sqlite_serdes` and subsequent SQLite builders to [brick_sqlite_generators](https://github.com/GetDutchie/brick/tree/main/packages/brick_sqlite_generators), and all OfflineFirst-specific logic to [brick_offline_first_with_rest_build](https://github.com/GetDutchie/brick/tree/main/packages/brick_offline_first_with_rest).
* `testing.dart` is available for useful testing methods
* This package is now a series of utilities and interfaces; it no longer produces generated code.

## 0.0.3

* Use `ConnectOfflineFirstWithRest`

## 0.0.2

* Uses `getDisplayString` instead of deprecated `name`
* Fix linter hints
