## Unreleased

* Add `reattemptForStatusCode` for `OfflineFirstWithRestRepository#upsert` requests. When the response matches a reattempt code, an exception is not thrown and the instance is returned instead.
* Add `501` to `OfflineQueueHttpClient#reattemptForStatusCode` defaults
* Insert a `created_at` column for the OfflineRequestQueue.
* Fix a bug where an HTTP request would be immediately duplicated. In some race conditions, the interval timer would immediately recreate the request after it was inserted and before the HTTP response was received.

## 0.0.6

* Remove maximumRequests configuration for the OfflineFirstQueue. One request should be processed at a time in serial
* Optionally ignore Tunnel not found requests (these occur when connectivity exists but the queried endpoint is unreachable) when making repository requests
* Adds argument to repository to reattempt requests based on the status code from the response
* `OfflineRequestQueue#process` became a protected method
* Added `RequestSqliteCacheManager` to interact with the queue. This new class receives most static methods from `RequestSqliteCache`.
* Added `OfflineRequestQueue#requestManager` to access queue via a `RequestSqliteCacheManager` instance.
* Renamed `RequestSqliteCache.unprocessedRequests` to `RequestSqliteCacheManager.prepareNextRequestToProcess` as the expected query only returns one locked row at a time.
* `RequestSqliteCacheManager.prepareNextRequestToProcess` locks _all_ unprocessed rows, not just the first one
* Add ability to toggle `serialProcessing` for `OfflineRequestQueue`
* Private member `OfflineFirstWithRestRepository#offlineRequestQueue` is now protected
* Remove `isConnected` member from `OfflineFirstRepository` and associated Connectivity code. The connection should not matter to the subclass as it, or a supporting class, should track outbound requests.

## 0.0.5+1

* Bump dependencies

## 0.0.5

* Rename `Query#params` to `Query#providerArgs`, reflecting the much narrower purpose of the member

## 0.0.2

* Export REST annotations/classes from `OfflineFirstWithRestRepository` for convenient access
* Don't require `MemoryCacheProvider` in `OfflineFirstWithRestRepository` as it's not required for `OfflineFirstRepository`
* Fix linter hints
