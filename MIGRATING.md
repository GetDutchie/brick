# Migrating Between Major Versions

## Migrating from Brick 1 to Brick 2

Brick 2 focuses on Brick problems encountered at scale. While the primary refactor was the abstraction of domain-specific code from generalized domains, this major release also includes a new GraphQL domain, resolution of community pain points, and a few neat tricks.

### Breaking Changes

* Brick no longer expects `lib/app`; it now expects `lib/brick`.
    ```shell
    mv -r lib/app lib/brick
    ```
* Models are no longer discovered in `lib/app/models`; they are now discovered via `*.model.dart`. They can live in any directory within `lib` and have any prefix. (#38)
    ```shell
    for FILENAME in lib/brick/models/*; do mv $FILENAME "${FILENAME/dart/model.dart}"; done
    ```
* `brick_offline_first` is now, fundamentally, `brick_offline_first_with_rest`. `brick_offline_first` now serves as an abstract bedrock for offline domains.
    ```shell
    sed -i '' 's/brick_offline_first:/brick_offline_first_with_rest:/g' pubspec.yaml
    for FILE in $(find "lib" -type f -name "*.dart"); do sed -i '' 's/package:brick_offline_first/package:brick_offline_first_with_rest/g' $FILE; done
    ```
* `brick_offline_first_abstract` is now `brick_offline_first_with_rest_abstract`
    ```shell
    sed -i '' 's/brick_offline_first_abstract:/brick_offline_first_with_rest_abstract:/g' pubspec.yaml
    for FILE in $(find "lib" -type f -name "*.dart"); do sed -i '' 's/package:brick_offline_first_abstract/package:brick_offline_first_with_rest_abstract/g' $FILE; done
    ```
* `rest` properties have been removed from `OfflineFirstException`. Use `OfflineFirstWithRestException` instead from `brick_offline_first_with_rest`.
* `OfflineFirstRepository#get(requireRemote:` and `OfflineFirstRepository#getBatched(requireRemote:` has been removed. Instead, use `policy: OfflineFirstGetPolicy.alwaysHydrate`
* `OfflineFirstRepository#get(hydrateUnexisting:` has been removed. Instead, use `policy: OfflineFirstGetPolicy.awaitRemoteWhenNoneExist` (this is the default).
* `OfflineFirstRepository#get(alwaysHydrate:` has been removed. Instead, use `policy: OfflineFirstGetPolicy.alwaysHydrate`.

### Fun Changes

* Utilize `OfflineFirstDeletePolicy`, `OfflineFirstGetPolicy`, and `OfflineFirstUpsertPolicy` to override default behavior. Specific policies will throw an exception when the remote responds with an error (and throw that error) or skip the queue. Existing default behavior is maintained.
* `OfflineFirstRepository#delete` now supports requiring a successful remote with `OfflineFirstDeletePolicy.requireRemote`. If the app is offline, normally handled exceptions (`ClientException` and `SocketException`) are `rethrow`n. (#182)
* `OfflineFirstRepository#upsert` now supports requiring a successful remote with `OfflineFirstUpsertPolicy.requireRemote`. If the app is offline, normally handled exceptions (`ClientException` and `SocketException`) are `rethrow`n.

### New Packages

* [`brick_graphql`](../packages/brick_graphql). The `GraphqlProvider` interfaces with a GraphQL backend. It uses [gql's Link system](https://github.com/gql-dart/gql/tree/master/links) to integrate with other community-supported functionality. That, and all your variables are autogenerated on every request.
* [`brick_graphql_generators`](../packages/brick_graphql_generators). The perfect companion to `brick_graphql`, this thin layer around `brick_rest_generators` battle-tested core compiles adapters for the GraphQL domain.
* [`brick_json_generators`](../packages/brick_json_generators). The experienced core separated from `brick_rest_generators` permits more code reuse and package creation for JSON-serving remote providers.
* [`brick_offline_first_build`](../packages/brick_offline_first_build). Abstracted from the experienced core of `brick_offline_first_with_rest_build`, these helper generators and utils simplify adding offline capabilites to a domain.
* [`brick_offline_first_with_graphql`](../packages/brick_offline_first_with_graphql). Utilize the GraphQL provider with SQLite and Memory cache. This is a near mirror of `brick_offline_first_with_rest`, save for a few exceptions. First, the OfflineQueueLink must be inserted in the appropriate position in [your client's Link chain](../packages/brick_offline_first_with_graphql#GraphqlOfflineQueueLink). Second, `OfflineFirstWithGraphqlRepository#subscribe` permits streaming updates, including notifications after local providers are updated.
* [`brick_offline_first_with_graphql_abstract`](../packages/brick_offline_first_with_graphql_abstract). Annotations for the GraphQL domain without including Flutter.
* [`brick_offline_first_with_graphql_build`](../packages/brick_offline_first_with_graphql_build). The culmination of `brick_graphql_generators` and `brick_offline_first_build`.

## Migrating to Brick 1 (Null Safety)

### Breaking Changes

* Because `required` is now a reserved Dart keyword, `required` in `WherePhrase`, `WhereCondition`, `And`, `Or`, and `Where` has been renamed to `isRequired`.
* Field types in models `Set<Future<OfflineFirstModel>>`, `List<Future<OfflineFirstModel>>`, and `Future<OfflineFirstModel>` are no longer supported. Instead, use `Set<OfflineFirstModel>`, `List<OfflineFirstModel>`, and `OfflineFirstModel` (the adapters will `await` each).
* `StubOfflineFirstWithRest` is functionally changed. SQLiteFFI has satisfied much of the original stubbing required for this class, and http's testing.dart library is sufficient to not require Mockito. Therefore, `verify` calls will no longer be effective in testing on the client. Instead, pass `StubOfflineFirstWithRest.client` to your `RestProvider#client` with the response values. `StubOfflineFirstWithRestModel` has been removed. Please review [Offline First Testing](https://greenbits.github.io/brick/#/offline_first/testing) for implementation examples.

### Improvements

* `brick_offline_first`: Priority for the next job to process from the queue - when processing requests in serial - has changed from `'$HTTP_JOBS_CREATED_AT_COLUMN ASC, $HTTP_JOBS_ATTEMPTS_COLUMN DESC, $HTTP_JOBS_UPDATED_AT ASC'` to `'$HTTP_JOBS_CREATED_AT_COLUMN ASC'`; this uses the job column introduced in 0.0.7 (26 May 2020) and will not affect any implementations using 0.0.7 or higher.
* `brick_offline_first`: `RequestSqliteCache` no longer queries cached requests based on headers; requests are rediscovered based on their encoding, URL, request method, and body. Rehydrated (reattempted) requests will be hydrated with headers from the original request.
* Every package is null safe. There is one outstanding dependency - `build_config` - that needs to be migrated, so the generators are not technically "null safe". However, these are dev dependencies and `build_config` isn't imported into Dart code, so upgrading it will be changing numbers.
