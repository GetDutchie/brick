# Brick Flutter Example

Before running this example in the simulator, create any missing Flutter files - `flutter create .` - and make sure the API is running: `dart server.dart`. Finally, generate Brick's code: `flutter pub run build_runner build`.

A progressive explanation of [this example can be found on Flutter by Example](http://www.flutterbyexample.com/#/posts/2_adding_a_repository).
